# Welcome to My Github Page!

## Hello, I'm David Ekpechue

I'm an Irish developer exploring the vast realms of programming. 

This GitHub is a showcase of my journey through computer science, where I share projects ranging from personal explorations to academic pursuits.

Hopefully, you find something you find useful, are impressed/ inspired by or enjoy!


## My Repositories

### Projects
A collection of my works that gradually grow in complexity.

It contains the totality of my completed ideas, the ideas I'm currently working on and the ideas have plans to complete.

### Unfinished-Projects
A glimpse into my process and ongoing learning journey.

I'm always experimenting with different technologies and tools, staying adaptable and curious but sometimes these processes don't go as planned, this repo is where I put these dead ideas to rest.
