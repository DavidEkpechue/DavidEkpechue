# Welcome to My Github Page!

## Hello, I'm David Ekpechue

I'm an Irish developer exploring the vast realms of programming. 

This GitHub is a showcase of my journey through computer science, where I share projects ranging from personal explorations to academic pursuits.

Hopefully, you find something you find useful, are impressed/ inspired by or enjoy!
